SHAP-based ML modeling of football betting market inefficiencies, with portfolio-level backtesting.

# ⚽ Football Betting Market Inefficiency (ML + SHAP + Portfolio Simulation)

This project explores inefficiencies in the football betting market using interpretable machine learning models and portfolio-level simulations.

It introduces an odds-layered segmentation framework, SHAP-based model interpretation, and probabilistic investment simulation using Kelly criterion.

## 🧠 Key Highlights
- Multi-layer odds binning + behavior-based mispricing detection
- 100+ engineered odds/statistical features
- SHAP analysis revealing feature importance and behavioral biases
- Portfolio-level backtesting with ROI, Sharpe, and Calmar ratio analysis

In this study, we compare the pricing patterns of multiple mainstream bookmakers,
including:
Bet365, William Hill, Ladbrokes, VCBet (BetVictor), Easybets, Interwetten, 10BET, 
12Bet, and 18Bet,
with the overall market average, represented by the aggregate odds statistics of all 
available bookmakers.
We analyze both the opening odds (initial lines) and live odds (current lines) across the 
following key dimensions:
Mean (average odds across bookmakers)
Median (middle value in sorted odds)
Standard Deviation (measuring odds volatility)
Quartiles (Q1 & Q3) (25th and 75th percentiles indicating spread of consensus)
This comparison enables us to:
Identify systematic pricing differences between mainstream and non-mainstream 
operators.
Assess volatility levels and potential market inefficiencies.
Detect value betting opportunities when odds from certain bookmakers significantly 
deviate from market consensus, especially in the context of live odds movements.
